# Money Minting Simulator

This project aimed to get me familarised with the React development cycle. In particular, I
1. Created a React project
2. Wrote relevant code for the project (a cookie clicker "clone": Money Minting Simulator)
3. Deployed the project to [Github Pages](https://brandontang89.github.io/MoneyMintingSimulator)
